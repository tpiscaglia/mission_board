# Mission Board

This is an interactive application that lets churches show members information about the missionaries they support. There are a few different views.  The initial view shows a map with markers visualizing where the missionaries are in the world.  If you click on the marker, you will be taken to a different screen that will have details about the missionary and show any recent letters from the missionary.
